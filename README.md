## Aim: to calculate the contamination rate from the simulated-data, implementing the model implemented in our recent work https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz660)



There are two steps:



1. Simulating data 

- **'simulating_data_steps.pdf'** contains all the steps needed to simulate data

- **'simulating_data_steps.pdf'** is present inside the current repository

  



2. Calculating **likelihood** function using data from the first step followed by 
- **optimizing** it to get maximum likelihood estimates (mle) of contamination rate


## Requirements:

- Python
